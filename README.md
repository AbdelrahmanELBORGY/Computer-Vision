# Computer-Vision
A collection of projects focused on advanced Computer Vision techniques, ranging from geometric transformations and image stitching to feature matching and object detection.

# Projects Overview
1. Image Mosaicing & Stitching
Implementation of automated image stitching to create seamless panoramas.

Key Features: Interest point detection (Harris Corner), descriptor matching, and RANSAC for homography estimation.

Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, NumPy.

Files: image_mosaic_2_imgs.ipynb, image_mosaics_3_imgs.ipynb.

2. Augmented Reality (AR) Fundamentals
Exploration of camera calibration and 3D-to-2D projections to overlay virtual objects onto real-world scenes.

Key Features: Estimating camera intrinsics/extrinsics and rendering 3D wireframes over detected markers.

Files: AR.ipynb.

3. Food Product Analysis & OCR
Integration of computer vision into functional software for health tracking.

Key Features: Real-time barcode scanning and nutritional data extraction using EasyOCR.

Tech Stack: Flutter, Python, FastAPI.
